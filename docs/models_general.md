{{card-start Instantiating Models}}
Models can be instantiated by calling lucid::model(string $modelName); Once instantiated, they can be used to query data from a table, update the table, insert new rows, or delete rows. Lucid's models are built on top of [Paris](https://github.com/j4mie/paris)([docs](http://paris.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)) and [Idiorm](https://github.com/j4mie/idiorm)([docs](http://idiorm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)). The [Querying](!database_querying) article of your wiki covers basic CRUD operations.
